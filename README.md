# indian_tv_ott
Currently supports yupptv only

I created this since my wife want to listen to Gurbani in the evening. No other XBMC/Kodi extension provide access to PTC punjabi. Currently, Yupptv is supported. I am planning to add more OTT providers based on the response. If yupptv comes up with its own extension for Kodi then I will be very happy to remove this. This extension exists because we are running in Tech boom and companies couddn't able to keep the pace. Still acclodes to Yupptv team for leading the industry with such a tech initiative.

You need to firstly install script.video.F4mProxy-2.2.6.zip (for F4m video format support) and then plugin.video.indianott.zip (For yupptv's Indian channels).
Please follow instruction as given at http://kodi.wiki/view/HOW-TO:Install_add-ons_from_zip_files.

**I will happy to accept patches and requests to add other OTT providers to this addon. Please open an issue for the same.**
